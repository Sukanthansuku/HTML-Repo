<P>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, 
and inferring information—demonstrated by machines,
as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or by other animals.
 AI uses multiple technologies that equip machines to sense, comprehend, 
plan, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Fundamentally, 
AI systems perceive environments, recognize objects, contribute to decision making,
solve complex problems, learn from past experiences, and imitate patterns. 
These abilities are combined to accomplish tasks like driving a car or recognizing 
faces to unlock device screens.</p>

<p>The AI landscape spreads across a constellation of technologies such as machine learning,
natural language processing, computer vision, and others. Such cutting-edge technologies 
allow computer systems to understand human language, learn from examples, and make predictions. </p>

<p>Although each technology is evolving independently, when applied in combination with other technologies,
data, analytics, and automation, it can revolutionize businesses and help them achieve their goals, be it 
optimizing supply chains or enhancing customer service.Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition,
computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, 
as well as other mappings of inputs.

Here’s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.

1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.

1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs.
just a list of instructions.

1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match.
It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.

2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 

2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes,
and other innovations make their debut.

2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine 
during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in 
only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. Main articles: History of artificial intelligence and
Timeline of artificial intelligence
Silver didrachma from Crete depicting Talos,
an ancient mythical automaton with artificial intelligence.
Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,
and have been common in fiction,
 as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.
 These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed 
in the ethics of artificial intelligence. <button><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+AI&source=lmns&bih=569&biw=1280&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjhqiL2K7_AhV2g2MGHWXuCFUQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA">Click Here</a></button>

<center><h3>Tools</h3></center>
AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.
Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search.
For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises 
to conclusions, 
where each step is the application of an inference rule.
 Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal,
a process called means-ends analysis.
 Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.

<center><h4>Goals</h4></center>
AI is primarily achieved by reverse-engineering human capabilities and traits and applying them to machines.
At its core, AI reads human behavior to develop intelligent machines. Simply put, the foundational goal of 
AI is to design a technology that enables computer systems to work intelligently yet independently. 
The essential goals of AI are explained below.The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has 
been broken down into sub-problems.
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an 
intelligent system to display.
The traits described below have received the most attention.

<center><h5>Benefits</h5></center>
To become successful in any kind of business, all you need is accurate collection of data, easy processing, 

adequate analytics, which further forms the backbone of decision-making and is required for vital insights. But,
the kind of volume and variety of data which is generated cannot be just handled by humans at this large- scale.

And hence, eventually the significance of artificial intelligence comes into the picture which plays a very vital 
role in segregating these huge datasets into useful and accurate pieces of information which makes human lives much easier. 

So, what are the benefits of AI and how does it affect our day to day lives? Here’s a detailed read on the advantages of 
artificial intelligence in the real world.

Key Benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence has pushed the boundaries of the way computer machines used to operate and functions to make human lives easier.
AI is a mammoth structure of super computers which helps in facilitating machines to act seamlessly and perform many human-like tasks.

Thus, it can be referred to as a magnificent creation of next-generation developments and progressions which 
leads to end-to-end automation and orchestration of various complex operations and thus reduces human error.

There is no doubt about that AI-enabled systems have been able to transform various industries through its several 
advantages which it has to offer in the following ways:One of the biggest advantages of Artificial Intelligence is 
that it can significantly reduce errors 
and increase accuracy and precision.
The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously gathered and a certain 
set of algorithms.
When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null.</p>

<center><h6>Types</h6></center>
Below are the various types of AI:

<ol type="I">

<center><li>Purely Reactive</li></center>
These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. 
For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win. 

<center><li>Limited Memory</li></center>
These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or
experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. 
For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant 
based on the location data that has been gathered.

<center><li>Theory of Mind</li></center>
This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on 
this type is yet to be built. 

<center><li>Self-Aware</li></center>
Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies.
They will be intelligent, sentient, and 
conscious.Purely Reactive. These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in 
just one field of work.
